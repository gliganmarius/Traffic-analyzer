Building AI course project


## Summary

Traffic Analyzer is an application that aims to predict the values of carbon emissions, traffic trends by subcategories of vehicles.

## Background

Pollution must have a downward trend in the years to come, and in order to make the right decisions both locally and globally we need to have some concrete data. This data can be provided by an application that analyzes car traffic, and which can predict with a certain accuracy, the categories of vehicles that pollute the most.

The data provided by the application could help to:
  * pollution
  * traffic congestion
  * types of vehicles
  * car age
  * the area of origin of the vehicles
